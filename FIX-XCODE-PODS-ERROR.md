# Fix Xcode Pods Configuration Error

## 🎯 The Problem
Xcode is looking for CocoaPods configuration files that don't exist. This happens when the iOS project wasn't fully initialized with dependencies.

## ✅ Solution: Run These Commands

**In Terminal, navigate to your project:**
```bash
cd "/Users/genesis/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Work/Lumen/LumenQI"
```

**Install dependencies and rebuild iOS project:**
```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Build the web app
npm run build

# Sync and update iOS project with all dependencies
npx cap sync ios

# Navigate to iOS directory and install Pods
cd ios/App
pod install
```

**Now open the correct file in Xcode:**
```bash
open LumenQI.xcworkspace
```

## 🔧 Alternative Fix (If Above Doesn't Work)

If you still get errors, completely regenerate the iOS project:

```bash
# From project root
npx cap add ios
npx cap sync ios
cd ios/App
pod install
open App.xcworkspace
```

## 🎯 Why This Happens

The error occurs because:
1. **CocoaPods not initialized** - The `Pods/` directory is missing
2. **Incomplete Capacitor sync** - iOS project wasn't fully configured
3. **Missing dependencies** - Native iOS dependencies weren't installed

## ✅ What Should Happen After Fix

Once fixed, Xcode will open with:
- ✅ No configuration errors
- ✅ All native dependencies available
- ✅ Lumen QI ready to build and run
- ✅ App Store deployment ready

## 📱 Quick Test

After opening in Xcode:
1. **Select iPhone Simulator** from device dropdown
2. **Click ▶️ Run button**
3. **Your Lumen QI app should launch** in the simulator

The Pods error will be completely resolved and your iOS app will be ready for development and App Store submission.
