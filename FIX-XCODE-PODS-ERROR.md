# Fix Xcode Pods Configuration Error

## üéØ The Problem
Xcode is looking for CocoaPods configuration files that don't exist. This happens when the iOS project wasn't fully initialized with dependencies.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Run These Commands

**In Terminal, navigate to your project:**
```bash
cd "/Users/genesis/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Work/Lumen/LumenQI"
```

**Install dependencies and rebuild iOS project:**
```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Build the web app
npm run build

# Sync and update iOS project with all dependencies
npx cap sync ios

# Navigate to iOS directory and install Pods
cd ios/App
pod install
```

**Now open the correct file in Xcode:**
```bash
open LumenQI.xcworkspace
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites Required

If you get "command not found" errors, you need to install development tools first:

**Install required tools:**
```bash
# Install Homebrew (if not installed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Node.js and npm
brew install node

# Install CocoaPods
sudo gem install cocoapods

# Install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install
```

**Then run the original fix commands above.**

## üîß Alternative Fix (If Still Getting Errors)

If you still get errors after installing tools, completely regenerate the iOS project:

```bash
# From project root
npx cap add ios
npx cap sync ios
cd ios/App
pod install
open LumenQI.xcworkspace
```

## üéØ Why This Happens

The error occurs because:
1. **CocoaPods not initialized** - The `Pods/` directory is missing
2. **Incomplete Capacitor sync** - iOS project wasn't fully configured
3. **Missing dependencies** - Native iOS dependencies weren't installed

## ‚úÖ What Should Happen After Fix

Once fixed, Xcode will open with:
- ‚úÖ No configuration errors
- ‚úÖ All native dependencies available
- ‚úÖ Lumen QI ready to build and run
- ‚úÖ App Store deployment ready

## üì± Quick Test

After opening in Xcode:
1. **Select iPhone Simulator** from device dropdown
2. **Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run button**
3. **Your Lumen QI app should launch** in the simulator

The Pods error will be completely resolved and your iOS app will be ready for development and App Store submission.
