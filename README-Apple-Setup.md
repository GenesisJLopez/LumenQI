### 2. Create Certificates & Provisioning Profiles

#### In Apple Developer Portal:

1. **Certificates**:
   - iOS: "Apple Distribution" certificate
   - Mac: "3rd Party Mac Developer Application" certificate
   - Mac: "3rd Party Mac Developer Installer" certificate

2. **App IDs**:
   - Bundle ID: `com.lumen.qi`
   - Enable capabilities: Push Notifications, Siri, Background App Refresh

3. **Provisioning Profiles**:
   - iOS Distribution: "Lumen QI iOS Distribution"
   - Mac App Store: "Lumen QI macOS Distribution"

### 3. Install Certificates

1. Download certificates from Apple Developer Portal
2. Double-click to install in Keychain Access
3. Verify certificates appear in "My Certificates"

## üì± iOS App Store Deployment

### Step 1: Initialize iOS Project

```bash
# Initialize Capacitor for iOS
npm run capacitor:init
npm run capacitor:add:ios
npm run capacitor:sync
```

### Step 2: Configure Xcode Project

```bash
# Open iOS project in Xcode
npm run capacitor:open:ios
```

In Xcode:
1. Select your Team in "Signing & Capabilities"
2. Verify Bundle Identifier: `com.lumen.qi`
3. Add required capabilities:
   - Background App Refresh
   - Push Notifications
   - Siri
   - Speech Recognition
   - Microphone
   - Camera
   - Location Services

### Step 3: Build and Archive

```bash
# Automated build and archive
./scripts/deploy-to-app-store.sh
```

Or manually in Xcode:
1. Product ‚Üí Archive
2. Distribute App ‚Üí App Store Connect
3. Upload to App Store Connect

## üñ•Ô∏è Mac App Store Deployment

### Step 1: Build Electron App

```bash
# Build for Mac App Store
npm run dist:mas
```

### Step 2: Sign and Package

The deployment script handles signing automatically if certificates are configured:

```bash
# Build, sign, and package for Mac App Store
./scripts/deploy-to-app-store.sh
```

### Step 3: Upload to App Store Connect

```bash
# Upload Mac app
xcrun altool --upload-app \
  -f "dist-electron/LumenQI-macOS.pkg" \
  -u "your-apple-id@example.com" \
  -p "app-specific-password"
```

## üé® Assets & Icons

```bash
# Generate all required icon sizes
./scripts/build-apple-icons.sh
```

This creates:
