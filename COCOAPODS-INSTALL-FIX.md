# Fix CocoaPods Installation Issue

## ðŸš¨ CocoaPods Installation Hanging

If `sudo gem install cocoapods` hangs or gets stuck, try these solutions:

## Solution 1: Use Homebrew Instead

Cancel the hanging command (Ctrl+C) and use Homebrew:
```bash
# Cancel the hanging command first: Ctrl+C
brew install cocoapods
```

## Solution 2: Use Alternative Ruby Source

If Homebrew doesn't work, try installing from a different gem source:
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods --source https://rubygems.org/
```

## Solution 3: Install with Verbose Output

See what's happening during installation:
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods --verbose
```

## Solution 4: Alternative - Skip CocoaPods for Now

You can actually build your Lumen QI iOS project without CocoaPods initially:

```bash
cd "/Users/genesis/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Work/Lumen/LumenQI"

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Build the web app
npm run build

# Create iOS project (this will work without CocoaPods)
npx cap add ios
npx cap sync ios

# Open directly in Xcode
cd ios/App
open LumenQI.xcworkspace
```

## Verify Your Installation Status

Check what's already installed:
```bash
# Check if Node.js is working
node --version
npm --version

# Check if CocoaPods is actually installed
pod --version
```

## Quick Alternative: Use Xcode's Built-in Package Manager

Instead of CocoaPods, Xcode can manage dependencies automatically. Just:

1. Open `LumenQI.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. If prompted about missing packages, let Xcode resolve them
3. Build and run your app

Your Lumen QI project should work even if CocoaPods installation is problematic. The core iOS project structure is already in place.
