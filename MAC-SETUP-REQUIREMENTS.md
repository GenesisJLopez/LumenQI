# Mac Setup Requirements for Lumen QI iOS Development

## Current Status
Your Lumen QI project is now ready for iOS development after resolving all CocoaPods and Capacitor dependency issues.

## Required Tools on Mac
1. **Node.js** - For building the web application
2. **Xcode** - For iOS development (already installed)
3. **Apple Developer Account** - For App Store deployment (you have this)

## Git Lock File Issue
The GitHub App shows a lock file error. This is common and can be resolved:

### Option 1: Delete Lock File
```bash
cd "/Users/genesis/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Work/Lumen/LumenQI"
rm -f .git/index.lock
```

### Option 2: Skip Git Sync (Recommended)
Since you already have the project files locally, Git sync isn't necessary for iOS development. You can proceed directly with Xcode.
