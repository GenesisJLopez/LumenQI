# Exact Steps to Transfer Lumen QI to Xcode

## 🎯 The File Doesn't Exist Because You Need to Download It First

The terminal command assumes you have the project on your Mac. Here are the exact steps:

## Step 1: Download from Replit to Your Mac

**In Replit:**
1. Look at the left sidebar with your files
2. Click the **3-dot menu** (⋯) at the top of the file explorer
3. Select **"Download as zip"**
4. Your browser will download a file called `lumenQI.zip`
5. The file goes to your **Downloads** folder

## Step 2: Extract the Project on Your Mac

**Open Terminal on your Mac and run:**
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
ls -la lumenQI.zip
```

If you see the zip file, extract it:
```bash
unzip lumenQI.zip
ls -la lumenQI/
```

You should now see the `lumenQI` folder with all your Lumen QI files.

## Step 3: Navigate to the iOS Project

```bash
cd lumenQI/ios/App
ls -la
```

You should see:
- `App.xcworkspace` (this is what you need to open)
- `App.xcodeproj`
- `App/` folder

## Step 4: Open in Xcode

```bash
open App.xcworkspace
```

## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "No such file or directory"
**Problem:** You haven't downloaded the project from Replit yet
**Solution:** Complete Steps 1-2 above

### Issue: "lumenQI.zip not found"
**Problem:** Download didn't complete or went to different location
**Solution:** Check your browser's download location or re-download

### Issue: "Cannot open App.xcworkspace"
**Problem:** Xcode not installed or wrong file
**Solution:** 
- Install Xcode from Mac App Store
- Make sure you're opening `.xcworkspace` not `.xcodeproj`

## 🔍 Verify Your Download

After extracting, you should have this structure:
```
~/Downloads/lumenQI/
├── ios/App/App.xcworkspace  ← This is what you open
├── client/                  ← React frontend
├── server/                  ← Express backend
├── package.json
└── XCODE-SETUP-GUIDE.md
```

## 📱 Alternative: Use Finder

Instead of terminal commands:
1. Open **Finder**
2. Go to **Downloads** folder
3. Double-click `lumenQI.zip` to extract
4. Navigate to `lumenQI → ios → App`
5. Double-click `App.xcworkspace`

The key is downloading the project from Replit first. The files don't exist on your Mac until you download them!
