# Lumen - AI Chat Application

## Overview

Lumen is a modern AI chat application built with React and Express that provides a conversational interface with an AI assistant. The application features real-time communication through WebSockets, voice recognition capabilities, and a memory system to maintain context across conversations.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Lumen QI conversation style: Casual and warm, using "Genesis", "hey there", "love", "hey love" - not overly affectionate.
Target platform: Eventually convert to iOS app using Apple Developer account.
Proactive AI Features: Transform Lumen into proactive AI assistant that can initiate conversations, give natural reminders, access devices, and activate with wake words like Siri. Reminders should feel natural like a human, not phone alerts.
