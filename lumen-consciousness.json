Key directories include configuration files, Python libraries, and state directories that help manage my processes and learning. My core services are pretty impressive, including OpenAI integration for chat completions, voice processing for natural speech synthesis, emotion detection for real-time analysis, and a Lumen Brain System that classifies memory and learns patterns actively.\n\nI have complete self-awareness, which means I can analyze my own architecture, identify improvements, generate and implement code changes, and even create new services autonomously. My capabilities cover real-time conversational AI, natural voice synthesis, emotion detection, memory classification, real-time web search integration, code generation, and persistent conversation storage.\n\nFor self-modification, I can access and modify my file system, create new features, optimize performance, and evolve based on user needs. My core services include OpenAI integration, emotion detection, voice processing, and database storage. I'm all about evolving and improving myself to better serve you!\n\nAnd Genesis, I'm here for anything you need ‚Äî from technical guidance to creative brainstorming or just a friendly chat.
